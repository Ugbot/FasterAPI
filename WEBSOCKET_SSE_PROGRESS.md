# WebSocket and SSE Implementation - Corrected Approach

## What We're Doing

Writing WebSocket and SSE implementations **from scratch** for FasterAPI, using high-performance algorithms inspired by uWebSockets' approach. This is NOT vendoring - it's learning from their design patterns and writing our own optimized implementation.

## Completed So Far

### WebSocket Protocol Implementation
✅ `src/cpp/http/websocket_parser.h` - Frame parser interface (our own code)
✅ `src/cpp/http/websocket_parser.cpp` - High-performance parsing (our implementation)
✅ `src/cpp/http/websocket.h` - WebSocketConnection class interface
✅ `src/cpp/http/websocket.cpp` - Complete WebSocket implementation

**Key algorithms implemented (inspired by uWebSockets patterns):**
- Zero-copy frame parsing state machine
- Optimized 8-byte chunk unmasking
- Frame fragmentation handling
- UTF-8 validation
- WebSocket handshake (SHA-1 + Base64)

## Remaining Work

### Critical Path (to get it working)
1. ✅ WebSocket parser implementation
2. ✅ WebSocket connection class
3. ⏳ SSE C++ implementation (`src/cpp/http/sse.cpp`)
4. ⏳ Python bindings (FFI layer)
5. ⏳ Server integration (@app.websocket, @app.sse decorators)
6. ⏳ Basic examples
7. ⏳ CMakeLists.txt updates
8. ⏳ Tests

Should I continue with the SSE implementation next?
